    <p>
          To encourage you to become more familiar with the Eclipse debugger, we have created a short (~30min - 1hr) optional extra credit debugging assignment.  On <a href="{{pathToRoot}}assn/debugger.html">the extra credit information page</a>, you will find an Eclipse project
          that is <i>supposed</i> to animate a ball that bounces off the 4 walls.  However, there
          are some bugs lurking that are preventing the program from functioning correctly.  If you can find and fix all 4 bugs, the program will give you a secret code that you can send to your Section Leader for extra credit points!  See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}assn/debugger.html">the extra credit information page</a> if you're interested in trying it out.  The answers will be released alongside the section solutions at the end of the week, so if you would like to get extra credit points <strong>you must email your secret code to your Section Leader by 5PM on Friday 3/3.</strong>

          In your penultimate assignment you will program a data visualizer: NameSurfer. See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}assn/nameSurfer.html">assignment page</a> for the handout and starter code.  <strong>Assignment 6 YEAH hours will be Wednesday March 1st, 7:30-9PM in Bishop Auditorium </strong> (in Lathrop Library).

          One of the joys of programming is the ability to make something totally of your own creation. In CS106A this quarter we are hosting a Graphics Contest where you can program anything you like using the concepts and tools we learn in class. There will be four grand prizes which each are worth a 100% on the final exam. Runners up will be awarded extra credit on assignments. See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/26 - Graphics Contest.pdf">contest handout</a> for more details.

    <p>
            Graded CS106A midterms were returned after class on Wednesday, Feb. 22 via <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a>, an online assignment grading website; if you did not receive an email inviting you to Gradescope (check your spam folder just in case), please <a href= "mailto:troccoli@stanford.edu">email Nick, the Head TA.</a> See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}handouts/30 - Midterm Solutions.pdf">midterm solutions</a> for reference. If your scanned exam in Gradescope is difficult to read, and you would like to see your (ungraded) paper exam, you can pick it up from the CS106A filing cabinet in the "handout hangout", the lobby down the hall from Chris's office (Gates 193).  Please note that while grading we referenced both the paper and scanned versions to ensure your work was correctly graded.

            <br />
            <br />

            The median for the CS106A midterm was 41 out of 60 points. Here is the full distribution:
            <img style="width:100%" src = "{{pathToRoot}}img/general/midtermDist.png"></img>
            

            <br />
            <br />

            If you believe part of your exam was incorrectly graded, regrade requests will be accepted through <a href="https://gradescope.com">Gradescope</a> until <strong>Wednesday, March 1.</strong>  As part of your request, you will need to provide a short write-up of the problem(s) on your exam that you think were misgraded.  Regrade requests need to point out the aspect of the problem that was correct, but for which points were taken off.  We use a detailed rubric to grade exams, so simply requesting that an incorrect answer <i>"should be worth more points"</i> is not likely to result in additional points.  Also, we reserve the right to re-grade the whole exam to make sure there are no other grading issues present - this may result in a lower total score.

          In your fifth assignment you will program the classic game of Yahtzee! See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}assn/yahtzee.html">assignment page</a> for the handout and starter code.  <strong>Assignment 5 YEAH hours will be Tuesday 2/21, 7:30-9PM in Bishop Auditorium </strong> (in Lathrop Library).

    </div>

    <p>
          We found a small bug when running the Hangman starter code on Windows machines.  Specifically, due to the way Windows displays Eclipse programs, the height of the screen is 20 less than when running on a Mac.  For this reason, the constant Y value given for the incorrect guesses label (<code>INCORRECT_GUESSES_Y</code>) is off-screen.

          <br />

          To resolve this issue (for consistency, every student please do this, Mac or PC), <strong>PLEASE CHANGE <code>INCORRECT GUESSES_Y</code> and <code>PARTIALLY_GUESSED_Y</code> to the following:</strong>

          <br />
          <br />

          <code>  
          /* The y-location to display the partially guessed string */
          <br />
          private static final int PARTIALLY_GUESSED_Y = 430;
          <br />
          /* The y-location to display the incorrectly guessed letters */
          <br />
          private static final int INCORRECT_GUESSES_Y = 460;
          </code>

          <br />
          <br />

          The starter code on the website has also been updated to reflect this change.

          We apologize for the last-minute change; if you do not make the above change, you will not be penalized if your incorrect guesses label is offscreen, as long as you are positioning it correctly.  But the above change may help ensure that your calculations are correct.

If you would like to switch into a different section to be with a requested partner, please request a swap by filling out <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/5mXLeVpGgQnv43xf2">this form</a>.  For the second form, please be sure to fill out ALL possible times you and your partner are free, not just your current section times.

            Reminder that today, Jan 15th, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day">MLK day</a> so there will be <b>no classes</b>. LaIR office hours</a> will start this evening at 6pm. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a video of the last public speech MLK gave. The date was April 3, 1968 and he was assassinated the day after. Civil rights for all people, regardless of their ethnicity, is a cause that is still being fought for around the world.

In 1967 MLK gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3H978KlR20"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video" aria-hidden="true"></span> speech at Stanford</a> where he directly addressed students and faculty.

    <p>
        Section signups are now open!  Click on the "Section" tab at the top and select "Section Signup" to submit your preferences.  As a reminder, signups are <strong>not first come first serve</strong>.  As such, you may modify your preferences any time up until the Sunday 5PM deadline.  We will notify you of your section assignment early next week.

        <br />
        <br />

        <strong>Note:</strong> Remote SCPD students (if you are an SCPD student but able to attend a section on campus, you may disregard this message) should instead click on the "Remote SCPD Signup" link in the "Section" tab.  Remote SCPD students will not be assigned a physical section; instead, you will have access to online recordings of one section this quarter, and another assigned Section Leader to grade your assignments.

                    The assignment is due Friday, Jan 19th, but make sure to get started early. Though Karel is a fun, simple robot, some of the questions can take a lot of time.

    <p>
        In CS106A we use a free, "development environment" called <img src="img/icons/eclipse-icon.png" class="sidebaricon" alt="icon" style="margin-bottom: 2px;"> Eclipse to write our programs. It is the most popular development environment for the Java language. Download eclipse by following <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/dept/cs_edu/eclipse/">these instructions</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you run into any issues while installing or using Eclipse, please see the bottom of the Eclipse install instructions for common troubleshooting steps.  There will also be an Eclipse installation troubleshooting session <span class=" glyphicon glyphicon-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></span> Thursday the 11th of Jan, 7pm to 9pm in the LaIR. Try to install Eclipse before and come if you have any trouble.
