<p>
	On Assignment 1, <strong>you must limit yourself to the Java features shown in the Karel coursereader.</strong>  There are too many features to list them all, but in general you should match the Java features used in the sample programs in class and in the Karel coursereader and not use any Java features outside of those.  In particular, you should not use the following:
</p>

<dl>
	<!-- Variables -->
	<dt>
		Variables
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You are not allowed to use any variables, such as:</p>
		<pre class="code-bad">
<span class="code-comment">// bad</span>
<em>int steps = 42;</em>
while (steps > 0) {
	move();
	turnLeft();
	steps = steps - 1;
}</pre>
	</dd>

	<!-- Instance variables -->
	<dt>
		Instance Variables
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>These are the 'private' variables that are declared outside of methods.  These are just another form of variables and should not be used on Assignment 1.</p>

		<pre class="code-bad">
<span class="code-comment">// bad</span>
public class MyKarel extends Karel {
	<em>private int count;</em>

	public void run() {
		<em>count = 5;</em>
		...
	}
}</pre>
	</dd>

	<!-- special keywords -->
	<dt>
		<code>break</code>, <code>return</code> and <code>continue</code>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>You should not use any of these keywords on Assignment 1, as they are not included in the Karel coursereader.</p>
	</dd>

	<!-- Parameters -->
	<dt>
		Parameters
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Java methods are able to accept parameters that affect their behavior. This is not included in the Karel coursereader and is not permitted on Assignment 1.</p>

		<pre class="code-bad">
<span class="code-comment">// bad</span>
public void walk(<em>int numSteps</em>) {
	for (int i = 0; i &lt; numSteps; i++) {
		move();
	}
}</pre>
	</dd>
</dl>
