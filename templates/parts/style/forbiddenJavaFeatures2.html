You may now use Java features.  However, you may not use the following:
<br />
<br />

<dl>
	<!-- System.exit() -->
	<dt>
		System.exit()
	</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Java contains a <code>System.exit</code> method that immediately exits your entire program. You should never call this method in our assignments for any reason. Your program should always exit naturally by reaching the end of your <code>run</code> function and returning.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>
