					Karel has been hired to build the columns in the Temple of Artemis in Efes. In particular, there are a set of arches where the stones (represented by beepers, of course) are missing from the columns supporting the arches, as follows:
				</p>
				<p>
					<center>
						<img style="width:600px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/efes/efesBroken.png">	
					</center>
				</p>
				<p>
					When Karel is done, the missing columns should be replaced by beepers, so the final picture would look like this:		
				</p>
				<p>
					<center>
						<img style="width:600px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/efes/efesRepaired.png">	
					</center>
				</p>
				<p>
					Karel may count on the following facts about the world, listed below:
				<ul>
					<li>Karel starts at 1st Avenue and 1st Street, facing east.
					<li>The columns are exactly four squares apart, on 1st, 5th, 9th and 13th Avenue.
					<li>Karel can assume that columns are always five units high.
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though the program is only a few lines, it is still worth getting a little practice in decomposition. For example, it would make sense to have a <code>buildColumn</code> method.

				<h2>For Loops</h2>
				<p>One thing that computers are really good at is repeating commands.</p>

				<p>
					In general, if you know before hand that there is a block of code you would like to repeat many times you can use a "for" loop, which looks like this:

					<div class="well">
						<code>
							for(int i = 0; i &lt; <i>N</i>; i++) {
								<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>your code</i>
							<br/>}
						</code>
					</div>
					Instead of <i>N</i> you should write the number of times you want your code to be repeated.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example if you want to move forward ten times, instead of writing the move(); command ten times you could write
					<div class="well">
						<code>
							for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
								<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;move();
							<br/>}
						</code>
					</div>
					See the <a href="{{pathToRoot}}projects/place100.html">Place 100 beepers</a> program for another example.
				</p>
				<p>Your program will be much easier to write and easier to read, if you use for loops. There are multiple opportunities to use for loops in this problem!
