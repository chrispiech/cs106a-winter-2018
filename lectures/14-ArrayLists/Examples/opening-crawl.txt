Karel Wars Episode VII:
Revenge of the SuperKarel







An evil SuperKarel is threatening to
disturb the grid world once again.
What was once a peaceful planet has
now been thrown into chaos.

By taking the turnRight() command
hostage, SuperKarel has forced all
other Karels to turnLeft() three times.

The Karels' only hope to avoid code
bloat is to re-implement turnRight()
themselves.  However, all Karels have
forgotten how to write a Karel program.

All but one...
